# ML1_Bike-Sharing-Assignment_Linear-Regression

This project aims to create a model to predict the demand for shared bikes for BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, which has faced revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to understand the factors affecting bike demand and use these insights to prepare for future needs, adjust business strategies, and enhance market position.

## General Information
This project involves creating a model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors. It aims to help BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, recover from revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic by understanding and catering to future bike demand.

Context:
- Service Description: Bike-sharing systems provide bikes for short-term use, either for a fee or free. Users typically borrow a bike from a computer-controlled dock and return it to any dock within the system.
- Current Challenge: BoomBikes has faced revenue dips during the pandemic and seeks to develop a business plan to boost revenue once normalcy returns.
- Objective: The company aims to understand the factors affecting bike demand to better prepare and meet future needs, thereby distinguishing itself from competitors.

Business Goals:
- Identify significant variables that predict bike demand.
- Understand how these variables influence demand.
- Use the model to adjust business strategies and meet customer expectations.
- Gain insights into the demand dynamics of new markets.

Data Description:
- The dataset includes daily bike demand data in the American market, influenced by various factors like meteorological conditions and user behavior.

- The model will utilize these independent variables to predict the target variable (count), representing total bike rentals.
- By achieving these goals, BoomBikes aims to enhance its market position and profitability.

## Technologies Used
- Python: 3.12.3
- numPy: 2.2.2
- pandas: 2.2.2
- matplotlib: 3.10.0
- seaborn: 0.13.2
- scikit-learn: 1.6.1
- statsmodel: 0.14.4

## Conclusions
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes
- Year
- holiday
- temperature
- windspeed
- Season (summer, and winter)
- months (January, August, September)
- Weekday (saturday, sunday)
- weathersit (Light snow/rain, Mist)
